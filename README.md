# FirstPageWithJS
This is the result of one of my first assignments in Programming 1 class, a little project to start applying some basic JavaScript code to a webpage.
There's some CSS and some HTML as well.
Note: I'm not great with web design (yet), but having the page being entirely white was hurting my eyes a bit, so I changed the colors based on that only.
